# Jeremy Vachier

### Theoretical Physicist | Associate Director Data Science / Senior Data Scientist

## About

I am an Associate Director of Data Science building production machine learning systems for pharmaceutical manufacturing that combine rigorous GxP compliance with cutting-edge ML techniques. My journey from theoretical physics to industrial ML gives me a unique perspective on solving complex problems at the intersection of fundamental science and practical engineering.

I hold a PhD in Theoretical Physics from the Max Planck Institute for Dynamics and Self-Organization, where I specialized in stochastic processes and non-equilibrium statistical mechanics. After completing a Postdoctoral position followed by a Researcher position at NORDITA (Nordic Institute for Theoretical Physics) in Applied Mathematics, I transitioned to industry, bringing deep mathematical foundations to real-world ML challenges.

## Current Focus

- **Production ML Systems**: Building GxP-compliant models for pharmaceutical manufacturing (autoencoders, VAEs, RL, GenAI, predictive maintenance)
- **From-Scratch Implementations**: Building deep learning architectures without pre-trained models to deeply understand fundamentals (Transformers, attention mechanisms, custom training pipelines)
- **Physics-Informed ML**: Applying stochastic process theory and statistical physics to machine learning problems
- **Competitive ML**: Kaggle Expert 
- **Open Source Research Tools**: Scientific literature RAG systems, GPU-accelerated implementations, production-grade ML pipelines
